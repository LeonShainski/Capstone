# This is the script that will take news articles from our feeds and create a short summary of any given article

This helps our users get the gist of the news article quickly without having to necessarily read the entire article (though that option is available), whilst also providing a concise version of the article to aide our machine-learning platform to more easily examine the contents of the article, and as such, allow for a more accurate categorization of the article.
