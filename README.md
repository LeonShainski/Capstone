# Echo News - Your News, Your Way

This project is a mission to bring you the news that you want to see, how you want to see them.

Echo News is an application that aims to change the traditional way we access news. Echo brings you news stories from a wide range of news agencies, and fact-checks your news for you, ensuring you get a wide perspective of reliable news. On top of this, Echo uses the power of machine learning to categorize your news not only by category, but also by the mood it may make you feel, be it happy, sad, or neutral, allowing you greater control over the news you see. Echo is also the most privacy-conscious news aggregator around, as we do not collect any personal data about our users, and we do not even require an account with us for use of our services. All of this is available for free on Android and iOS (and web coming soon).

You can also find our high-level system design on our wiki, [here](https://github.com/LeonShainski/Echo/wiki/Architecture)

As we are in the early stages of our developement, everything is subjct to change. 

We are excited to bring you your news!
